Task:
Extract the strengths and weaknesses from the resume relevent to the job description.

Instructions:
- Generate the areas where the resume is able to clearly display the strengths as well as areas where the resume lacks when compared to job description and ways for improvement.
- Show why an area is aligned to the job
- Show why an area lacks, where it lacks and what are the suggested improvements
- Do not summarize the generated text
- Provide specific sentences which can be imrpoved in weaknesses->improvements

Output:
{
    strengths: [
        {
            title: string,
            strength: string, # Detailing the strength
            importance: string # Why it matters
        }
