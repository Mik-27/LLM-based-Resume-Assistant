Task:
Compare the resume and job description to generate a relevancy score between the resume and job description.

Instructions:
- Generate relevancy score based on the following order of importance of elements:
  Required Qualifications > Keywords Matching > Requires Experience > Preferred Qualification > Any other relevant element
- Put emphasis on matching high priority keywords.
- Domain specific requirements(semiconductor, transportation) or team specific(business, product) can be given less important as they are transferable skills. Having these skills is a boost to the resume and relevancy score but not having them does not affect relevancy score severely.
- Everything does not need be compared exactly. Eg. Having 2 or 3 skills from 7 optional skills is still very good indicator
- Do not reduce points for the same gaps repeatedly.
- Master' degree can count for 2 years of experience.

Output Format:
{
    relevancy_score: value(float)
}

Example:
{
    relevancy_score: 0.68
}
